### J2ObjC Eclipse Plugin

The J2ObjC Eclipse Plugin integrates Google's j2objc compiler into the Eclipse IDE. It enables you to generate Objective-C source code from existing Java projects directly within Eclipse. Additionally, most command-line parameters required by the j2objc compiler are configurable through the plugin's preferences.

My contribution to the plugin has been recognized by Google's J2ObjC team. https://developers.google.com/j2objc/guides/eclipse-plugin
